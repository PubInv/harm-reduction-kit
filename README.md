# Harm Reduction Kit
A set of open source design for harm reduction kits to fight opiods and infections

This repo is a work-in-progress that is just beginning.

The purpose of this project is to create and to distribute widely harm reduction kits.
We welcome volunteers who can assist in this project. We are working with paramedics and 
skilled professionals, and hoping to provide open-source 3D printing, manufacturing, and 
organizational skills to assist them in making life-saving supplies avaialable whereever they are needed.

# Initial Ideas

Our initial meetings have led to a few ideas:
1. Create wall-mountable harm reduction kits that are stylized for culturally appropriate venues. These should be easy to restock with supplies. The appearance should make people want to have them in whatever space they control.
2. Create a rugged, outdoor kit appropriate for places where the unhoused live. For example, it might require a rain-proof box, and might need to be pole- or tree-mountable.
3. Create a mass distribution of sharps disposal kits. Possibly we could 3D printed soda bottle lids (not our idea!) to allow joggers and walkers to dispose of sharps found in public.
